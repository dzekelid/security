description: Sift Science fights fraud with machine learning. Machine learning teaches
  a computer to mine data for statistical patterns, and continuously learn and adapt
  as new data streams in. With simple APIs that take minutes to integrate, an online
  business can leverage the latest in large-scale machine learning to protect themselves
  from fraud. Chargebacks, spammers, account takeovers, etc. Online businesses send
  Sift Science user events, which are mined for identity, behavioral, and network
  patterns that correspond to past fraud. Sift Science also pools fraud patterns across
  its network of customers. The network strengthens as more data streams in. Customers
  can also ldquo;train their own modelrdquo; and tailor their results via a simple
  interface.
